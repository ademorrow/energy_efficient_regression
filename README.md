# energy_efficient_regression
A regression analysis was performed on an energy efficiency dataset obtained from Kaggle:
Energy Efficiency Data Set (kaggle.com). The dataset uses multiple variables related to building design
and construction to predict heating and cooling loads for the dwelling. Several models were developed
and assessed, with XGBoost selected for the final model. The XGBoost model could achieve prediction
R2 scores of 0.9982 for heating load and 0.8951 for cooling load.
